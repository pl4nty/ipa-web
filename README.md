Search, view, and download iOS app metadata from App Store `.ipa` files. Currently supports:

* URL schemes
* Universal Links
* `Info.plist` download
* `entitlements.plist` download

If you'd like to see something from the plists in the web UI, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/pl4nty/ipa-web/issues/new).
